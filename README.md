# sql-challenge Module 9 Challenge
## Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Data Modeling
After inspecting the Starter_Code CSV files provided (located in the "CSV data files" folder), I created an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables with QuickDBD. https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

There were 6 total tables created: 
- departments
- titles
- employees
- salaries
- dept_emp
- dept_manager

The ERD image file is located in the Entity Relationship Diagram folder and is called "ERD Image file.png"

![ERD](https://github.com/kirbyjudd/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagram/ERD%20Image%20file.png?raw=true)

I also included the Diagram Documentation and QuickDBD text file in the Entity Relationship Diagram folder.
